# Midwest-jsPGA
Applying jsPGA model to temperate lake fish abundance dataset from seven Midwestern states in US

The two directories, ROAR and Local, hold the associated R and stan scripts for the full analysis associated with the paper "Climate-driven declines in abundance across thermal guilds in  fish communities of 11,000 temperate lakes".

Files within the ROAR directory are those used to fit the jsPGA model on Penn State's ROAR computing clusting.

Files within the Local directory are those used on the local machine to prepare the data for model fitting and those used to analyze the output from the model fitting process.

Each directory has an additional README file that details the purpose of each script.
